						<h1 class="coach_hd">Beto</h1>
						<p class="txt">Roberto Mendes da Silva, known simply as Beto is a Brazilian footballer who has become one of the most popular footballers in Indian football. Nicknamed ‘the Artist’, Beto has become synonymous with Dempo Sports Club – the club he has played for in two different stints. Having made his entry into Indian football by lining up for Mohun Bagan, Beto has gone on to successfully play for Goan powerhouses Churchill Brothers and Dempo. He is a 4 times I league winner – the only foreigner to have won it so many times.<br><br>
He has also lifted the historic Durand Cup twice. He was voted Midfielder of the Year 2008 – 2009 by the AIFF. While he boasts of multiple honours as a player, Beto’s finest contribution will undoubtedly be his performances in guiding Dempo to the AFC Cup semis – the first time an Indian club had managed to reach that stage. In his quest to give something back to the ‘beautiful game’, Beto, along with his close friend and fellow Brazilian Jose Ramirez Barretto initiated the Brasil Futbol Academia (BFA) in Goa. His vision was to share his experience to guide Indian youth and nurture them in a structured and professional environment wherein their potential could be maximized thus providing a consistent pool of talent ready to play at the highest level of Indian football. A testament to Beto’s commitment to this cause has been the academy’s steady performances in local and regional competitions with academy graduates being scouted by the top clubs of the country.

						<h1 class="coach_hd">Jose &nbsp; Ramirez &nbsp; Barretto </h1>
						<p class="txt">Hailing from the same city as the great Ronaldinho in Porto Alegre, Brazil, Barretto developed his initial footballing career at the famed Gremio academy again mirroring Ronaldinho. He has had the opportunity to have played under Luiz Felipe Scolari, when Scolari was the coach of the senior team in the academy.<br><br>
Barreto’s first stint in India was when he joined Mohun Bagan in 1999. He instantly became one of the most recognizable and loved players in India when he won the National Football League (NFL) title in his very first season in Indian football. In his second season, Barreto finished top scorer of the NFL with 14 goals. Barretto’s love affair with Mohun Bagan and their fans continued for the next 4 years wherein he was consistently amongst the top scorers of the league.<br><br> 
By the time he left Mohun Bagan in 2004, he had already won every major domestic trophy in India – Calcutta League, Durand Cup, Rovers Cup, IFA Shield and Federation Cup.
Barreto returned to India at the start of the 2005-06 campaign and joined the ambitious project at Mahindra United. The Mumbai club had roped in some of the best Indian players but it was Barreto’s signing that sent out a title warning to all other clubs. Barreto first guided Mahindra to Federation Cup success and then did the double by winning the league title.<br><br>
Barreto reunited with Mohun Bagan in 2006 where his strike partner was the legendary Bhaichung Bhutia. Barreto inspired them to Federation Cup success and alongwith Bhutia formed one of the most feared strike partnerships in the country. 
The key criteria to become a legend at Mohun Bagan or East Bengal are to perform in the big Kolkata derby. No other Mohun Bagan player has scored more goals than Barreto against East Bengal with the Brazilian netting 17 in total. <br><br>
In terms of statistics (more than 200 goals for Mohun Bagan), trophies, fan following, very few in Mohun Bagan’s illustrious history can match the Brazilian. Barreto’s success has inspired many other players from his country to ply their trade in India.
Last year, Barreto’s farewell game had an attendance of 35,000, a number unimaginable for the majority of I-League fixtures. Barreto has become a role model and he is eager to give something back to Indian football having lent his support to start a football academy with compatriot and friend Beto.
